Installation Instructions
*************************

For a successful build of CDPKit the following dependencies
need to be installed on the build host:

- Boost-devel C++ libraries (V >= 1.52, mandatory)
- Qt5-devel (optional)
- Cairo-devel (V >= 1.14, optional)
- Python-devel 2.x (optional) and Python-interpreter (mandatory)
- SQLite-devel V3 (optional)

CDPKit requires CMake V2.8.12 or higher for generating 
build makefiles. The makefiles are generated as follows
(assuming a Linux build):

> mkdir <BUILD-DIR>
> cd <BUILD-DIR>
> cmake <CDPKIT-SOURCE-DIR>

If the makefiles have been generated without errors, invoking
'make' from within <BUILD-DIR> starts the actual build process: 

> make

Building CDPKit should proceed without any issues at least on RHEL 7 based systems 
(other current systems should also work). 

If the build finished without errors

> make install

will install CDPKit in the /opt directory of your system (please refer to
the CMake documentation for how to change the default path).

Enjoy!!!!!
